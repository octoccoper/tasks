1. twoSum.js

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

2. findExtension.js

The function takes a string with the file name and returns the extension (fragment after the last dot). 
If there is no extension in the string - throw an exception.

3. selectionText.js

Function that find and select user text.

4. vowelsAndConsonants.js

Complete the vowelsAndConsonants function. 
It has one parameter, a string, s consisting of lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a through z). 
The function must do the following:
First, print each vowel in on a new line. The English vowels are a, e, i, o, and u, and each vowel must be printed in the same order as it appeared in s.
Second, print each consonant (i.e., non-vowel) in on a new line in the same order as it appeared in s.

5. regExpVar.js
Complete the function that return a boolean variable, re, that return true when our RegExp object matches any string that begins and ends with the same vowel. 


6. reverseNumber.js
Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:

Input: 123
Output: 321

Example 2:

Input: -123
Output: -321

Example 3:

Input: 120
Output: 21

Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. 
For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.


7. tripletsFind.js
Task:
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? 
Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.
