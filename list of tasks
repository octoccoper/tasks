1. twoSum.js

Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

2. findExtension.js

The function takes a string with the file name and returns the extension (fragment after the last dot). 
If there is no extension in the string - throw an exception.

3. selectionText.js
